            Modding in the Sims 4 is in some ways both extremely easy and mildly difficult. From a coding standpoint, the Sims 4 is extremely data-driven, and this makes it quite easy to add and modify almost every aspect of the game’s tuning that is not hidden behind C++. On the other hand, there is a bit of legwork that’s required in order to understand how to mod the game. The biggest hurdle in learning how to mod the game is understanding the TDESCS – tuning descriptions – which the Devs use as an internal documentation for the tuning structure of the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to understand how the XML tuning is laid out, as while one can haphazardly throw something together that “works,” it will often be rife with errors. Many beginning modders start out without fully understanding what they’re doing and can get stuck. I have also encountered people who wish to endeavor upon a journey of modding, only to not understand what they’re doing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The game is built on 3 principle levels, C++, which is impossible to access, Python, whose source code needs to be decompiled once every patch, and Tuning, which is custom XML that gets loaded and read by the game and turned into Python dynamically. Most of what can be achieved in game can be done with simple XML changes or additions, but sometimes Python is required. This is often called “injection,” as the custom tuning is “injected” into the game (since it can usually be hardcoded by being added into the tuning). Injection is done to prevent conflicts with other mods which would like to modify the same resource – for example, often configuration pie menus are added to mailboxes, and if the tuning for mailboxes were overridden instead of injected, only the first mod that overrode the tuning would be registered.
          </p>
          <p>
            This also brings up the interesting point of load order and conflicts. Sometimes, two mods will modify the same resource, and thus load order issues result. Only the first instance of a tuning will be loaded by the game, and all subsequent versions will be ignored. This means that parts of a mod which depend on these overrides may not work.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to mod the game, it is required to have at a minimum something which can extract and compile tuning to and from packages. The best tool for this is Sims 4 Studio, and it is what I personally use. A Python editor is also handy – personally, I use PyCharm. An invaluable tool also to have is the TDESC explorer, which allows an easy viewing of the TDESCs.

          <p>
            Before I get into the nitty-gritty of modding in the Sims 4, it's
            important to establish some ground terms so that when I refer to them
            later, it's clear what I mean.
          </p>
          <p>
            Below is a table of some terms relating to Sims 4 tuning which will
            be important to have some understanding of.
          </p>
          <table class="styled">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Term</th>
                <th>Definition</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <th>Loot</th>
                <td>
                  A loot is, for lack of a better term, a piece of code that
                  executes to perform some action. Often these are used to add
                  traits, buffs, and commodities to Sims.
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>Trait</th>
                <td>
                  A trait is a straightforward concept, in the strictest
                  sense – it is a flag on a Sim which can be used to add
                  various stuff. Traits are more permanent than buffs and can
                  be used to ensure that buffs (which can get lost during
                  travelling) stay added to the Sim. Traits can be used in
                  numerous ways to add buffs, commodities, and affordances
                  to Sims.
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>Buff</th>
                <td>
                  A buff, commonly called a moodlet, is also a type of flag on
                  a Sim. When they are visible, they often affect the mood of
                  the Sim they’re on, but they can do much more. Buffs can do
                  many things, like add affordances to Sims, add commodities,
                  change the decay rate of commodities, and more. They can
                  also be used to add CAS parts to Sims via appearance modifiers.
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>Appearance Modifer</th>
                <td>
                  An appearance modifier adds a temporary overlay to the Sim,
                  changing while active every outfit the Sim has.
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>CAS Part</th>
                <td>
                  CAS (Create A Sim) parts refer to the actual “item” the Sim
                  has on them.
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>Commodity</th>
                <td>
                  A commodity is a, on a very basic level, a number attached to
                  a Sim, that can increase and decrease within a given range.
                  Commodities have discreet ranges, called states, and when a
                  given commodity reaches a certain state, things (such as
                  buffs being added, or loots being fired) can occur.
                  Commodities are very useful and versatile tools, and can be
                  used for various things, such as timers, trackers, or with
                  traits in conjunction with proximity buffs, as an example.
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>Proximity Buff</th>
                <td>
                  A proximity buff is a buff that gets added to a Sim when
                  they are near (in proximity to) something, the something of
                  which is dependent on the tests described in the tuning.
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>Affordance</th>
                <td>
                  At the simplest level, an affordance is nearly synonymous
                  with what we could call an “interaction.” An affordance is
                  something that a Sim is “afforded” – usually an interaction,
                  but it can be other things as well.

                  PyCharm allows for creating and editing Python files, which
                  are the components of Script Mods. There is also a starter
                  project for Sims 4 Script Mods, which is another good reason

        <div id="tabs-4">
          <p>
            Some time around September of 2019, my friend (whom at the time I
            did not know very well) had requested a vampire for the Sims 4, one
            which would allow for vampires and their victims to get bloody when
            bitten. The modder who stepped forward to offer to make it, unfortunately,
            was soon revealed to be one that was anything but fast. To put it
            nicely, contents drift faster than they mod. They are also rather
            distractable, and had often given up on creating the mod for them in
            favour of pursuing other projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a few months of little to no progress, (and having gotten aquainted
            with who had at that point become a good friend of mine), I decided to
            surprise my friend during one of their lamentations about how the mod
            would never get finished.
          </p>
          <p>
            After 8 or so hours of intense modding, the first version of my mod
            was complete. Meanwhile, to date, the other modder still has not finished
            their implementation of this mod.
          </p>

          <p>
            In this most simple of senses, this mod allows for a more immersive
            experience when playing Vampires, by allowing that they and their
            victims become bloody. However, this mod is much more than just
            that. Below is a feature least of the mod as it current stands,
            which is important as what is in it and what I envisioned it having
            helped shaped what I did during my creation of the mod.
