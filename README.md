# Narrative Project
Details the process of creating a mod for the Sims 4

This project narrates my thought process and workflow for creating mods for the Sims 4, using of the mods I created for a friend. It details some background info necessary to understand the concepts discussed therein, as well as featuring a short prelude on how modding for the Sims 4 works in general, as well as a more tailored look at the mod in particular. This project also features real code used from the mod and documentation/explanations on what the code does, and why it's needed.
